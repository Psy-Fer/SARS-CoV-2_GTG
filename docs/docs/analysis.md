# Analysis

The analysis of the output to attain a consensus genome for each sample, as well as find the lineage information of each sample, is done using the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline and pangolin.

The are 2 methods within the ARTIC pipeline.

1. Nanopolish (uses both fastq and fast5 files)
2. Medaka (uses only fastq files)

We mostly use medaka for our routine samples. Either method works well enough for contact tracing and lineage analysis.


## Nanopolish

### Basic pipeline

### Single sample

### Multiple samples


## Medaka

### Basic pipeline

### Single sample

### Multiple samples
