Most of the information here is tested thoroughly with the Eden 2.5kb amplicon system, using the rapid barcoding kits, on PromethION flowcells. Most people will be using something else, and we recommend using the Midnight 1.2kb amplicons, or artic V3 amplicons. Parts of the pipelines must be modified for use with the appropriate amplicon scheme. We have tried to make it clear where in the processes these changes need to be implemented, along with some tips along the way. Please let us know if you have any questions, or require assistance.
